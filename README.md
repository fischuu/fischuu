My name is Daniel Fischer and I am living and working in Finland. I am a research scientist at the Luonnonvarakeskus / Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics. I was born in Dinslaken, Germany, and studied Statistics and Computer Sciences at the Technical University Dortmund, Germany. Since 2009 I am living in Finland, where I also did my PhD in Biostatistics.
